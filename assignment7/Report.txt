First task:
Simplification: Each handler focuses solely on its area of expertise, leading to clearer, more maintainable code.
Extensibility: Adding new types of requests or handlers is straightforward and doesn't require changes to existing code.
Decoupling: Handlers are decoupled from one another, promoting loose coupling and flexibility.
